            <h3>Project 1 : FASHION RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM</h3>
            <p>Fashion is one of the most critical industries in our world today. Style has become one of the 
              primary ways in which people express their personality and in which they distinguish 
              themselves from those around them. In this project, we are creating a Fashion 
              Recommendation System using Artificial Intelligence in order to classify the user’s clothes 
              from the images, identify the type and color of the outfit and finally recommend the most 
              suitable outfit for the given occasion based on the user’s existing clothes.</p>

            <h3>Project 2 : EMOTION BASED MUSIC RECOMMENDATION USING OPENCV</h3>
            <p>Music is the form of art known to have a greater connection with a person’s
              emotion. It has got a unique ability to lift up one’s mood. If a user receives a
              recommendation based on his preference, it will also improve his listing
              experience. Music recommendations have existed for a long time. Still, in most
              scenarios, the recommendation is decided after learning the user preferences over
              time, like looking at their past song preferences, the amount of time they listen to
              the music, etc. this project uses to song recommendation where their facial
              expressions detect a person's mood.</p>
